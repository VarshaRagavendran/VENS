# EECS4413-Building E-Commerce Systems 

## Description
This project-based course covers the software development life cycle of E-Commerce applications, and a study of the technical infrastructure that underlies E-Commerce on the Internet. It focuses on four Software Engineering phases: Analysis, Design, Implementation and Testing. 

Objective of this course is to build an e-commerce application following the Software Engineering process and obtain the knowledge and skills to build e-commerce applications similar to amazon.com, eBay.

## Learning Outcomes for the course: 
* Develop an appreciation of the pieces that make up the web landscape and how these pieces interact with each other.
* Aquire the skills needed to build a complete web application that incorporates session management, database access, and analytics on the server side, and page formatting and interactivity on the client side. 
* Build restful web services that interact with Ajax-powered client apps using a variety of transport protocols for data transfer. 
* Become familiar with, and adhere to, best practices and design patterns to ensure code maintainability, interoperability, and scalability, and to minimize exploitable vulnerabilities. 
* Learn how to build complex applications collaboratively through building abstractions and APIs, naming conventions, documentation, and organizing.
* Compare and contrast existing frameworks and approaches and develop an insight into the tectonic forces that are driving the trends.
